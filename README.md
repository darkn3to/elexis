• Utilizes the Volta testnet for secure transaction processing.

• Leverages blockchain for fraudless and transparent voting.

• Prioritizes user anonymity.

• Maintains transparency in the entire voting process.

• Utilizes blockchain features to prevent fraud, ensuring electoral integrity.

## Requirements
• <b>HardHat</b> for creating and managing our smart contracts.

• <b>MetaMask</b> browser extension for performing transactions.

• <b>Live Server</b> extension for running our web-app locally.

## Installation
1. Open terminal.

2. Clone the repository by using the command:
   ```cmd
   git clone https://github.com/darkn3to/elexis.git
   ```
   or simply donwload the zip file from the code dropdown button above.

3. Download and install node.js. Add it to your path.

4. Install hardhat by running the following command in the terminal: 
   ```cmd 
   npx hardhat
   ```
   then
   ```cmd
   npx hardhat init
   ``` 
   and 
   ```cmd
   npx hardhat compile
   ```

5. Create .env file as follows:
   ```.env
    API_URL="https://volta-rpc.energyweb.org/"
    PRIVATE_KEY="{THE_HIDDEN_KEY_IN_YOUR_METAMASK_ACCOUNT}" 
    CONTRACT_ADDRESS="{TOKEN_CONTRACT_ADDRESS}" 
    ```

## Usage

1. Add MetaMask extension to your browser and create an account if not already created.
 
   • You would also need to add Volta TestNet       to your account. Go to [this link](https://thirdweb.com/energy-web-volta-testnet) to get the details required to do so.      Then goto [this link](https://voltafaucet.energyweb.org/) to add Volta tokens needed to perform transactions.

2. Open deploy.js and add/remove names as per requirement.

3. Run the command:
    ```cmd
    npx hardhat run --network volta scripts/deploy.js
    ```
4. Copy paste the generated contract address into the main.js file. <b>The contract address generated here is different from the TOKEN CONTRACT ADDRESS used in .env file.</b>

5. Deploy index.html using live server.
